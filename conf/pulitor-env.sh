# The default log rolling policy is RFA, where the log file is rolled as per the size defined for the
# RFA appender. Please refer to the log4j.properties file to see more details on this appender.
# In case one needs to do log rolling on a date change, one should set the environment property
# PULSAR_ROOT_LOGGER to "<DESIRED_LOG LEVEL>,DRFA".
# For example:
# PULSAR_ROOT_LOGGER=INFO,DRFA
# The reason for changing default to RFA is to avoid the boundary case of filling out disk space as 
# DRFA doesn't put any cap on the log size. Please refer to HBase-5655 for more context.
